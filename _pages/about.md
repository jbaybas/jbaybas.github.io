Hello! I am a current Linguistics PhD student at the University of Michigan and a part of the [Computational Neurolinguistics Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/cnllab/) (PI: Dr. Jonathan Brennan).

Broadly speaking, I am interested in how two or more languages are accessed and processed within the brain. I find myself geared towards collecting experimental data in a matter that closely reflects our daily, natural usage of language (e.g., conversations). 

My current project investigates these underlying neural processes in bilingual code-switching comprehension using electroencepholography (EEG). I am also familiar and involved with projects using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), particularly with bilingual pediatric populations (see [Language & Literacy Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/kovelman-lab/), PI: Dr. Ioulia Kovelman). 

In my free time, I enjoy hiking nature trails, painting, live music, and playing Old School RuneScape.

Please feel free to reach out to me via email *(jbaybas@umich.edu)* if you would like to connect.
